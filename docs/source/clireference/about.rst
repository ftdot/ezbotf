**EzBotF CLI** (included with the main package) created for easily manage instances, plugins,
environment, etc.

How I can get help
------------------

You can get help about any command, just added ``--help`` or ``-h`` argument. Just example:

.. code-block:: shell

    ezbotf -h

Will print available subcommands and arguments.

To get help about **plugin** subcommand:

.. code-block:: shell

    ezbotf plugin -h

To get help about **instance** command:

.. code-block::

    ezbotf instance -h

That's all!
